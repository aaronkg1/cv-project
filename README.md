The brief of this project was to create a cv application using react class components. This was my first time building an App with React and as such, the code could definitely be refined. In the future, I will refactor the components to the more modern functiomal style.

Initially I designed my child components so that they set the values from input fields into their own state, before passing back these values as arguments to the prop functions. This was causing bugs where the values inputted into the form were always one step behind those displayed on the page. I learnt that this was due to the asynchronicity of the code awaiting promise resolution. Directly passed the value of inputs from the child components into the parent props solved these issues.
